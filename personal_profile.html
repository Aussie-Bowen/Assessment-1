        <p>Having participated in 3 different tests, personality, learning style and creativity, gives me the 
            opportunity to identify and validate my needs in a team environment but also to validate all team 
            members. Not just accepting different personalities, but seeing the importance of understanding 
            everybodyâ€™s needs for their unique learning styles and team productivity. When forming a team the 
            members varying learning styles and personality traits will be taken into consideration when 
            delegating individual tasks.</p>
