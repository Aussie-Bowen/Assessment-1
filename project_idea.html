        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>My project idea is for a scanner attached or installed to motor vehicles that will detect various 
            breaches of road rules. I would like to see this available in 2 different forms, one as an attachment 
            and the other being installed during the manufacturing of new vehicles. It will record when another 
            driver of a vehicle breaches a road rule and the video/data is instantly uploaded to the Department 
            of Transport and Main Roads, their insurer, and the authorities/police department.</p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>The scanner will assist in maintaining the safety of our community members by reducing the number of 
            accidents and fatalities. Tailgating is the most common cause of road rage accidents and fatalities 
            in our country. It is reported by <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-16/tailgating-is-stressful-
            and-dangerous/100837108" target="_blank">The Conversation</a>that in Queensland between 2019 and 2020, 
            there were more than 7,000 injuries and fatalities, and only 3,120 drivers were fined. Their research 
            showed that a fine and demerit points were a deterrent for tailgating.</p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sensors and cameras installed on exterior of the car, front, back left and right, with the central computer 
            inside the car. The sensors will calculate your speed and how many seconds are between you other cars and 
            warn you if the gap is less than 2 seconds. It will be able to detect speeding, wreckless driving, failure 
            to indicate, failure to give way and other infractions.</p>
        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>Reducing road accidents and deaths.</p>
        <h3>Further Investigation Required:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Patents against similar devices.</li>
            <li>Feasible co-operation of insurer, cops and transport</li>
            <li>Legality</li>
            <li>Rain interference</li>
        </ul>
