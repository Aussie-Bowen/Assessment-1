        <p>I am 17 years old I left school during grade 11 to learn Programming and IT 
            which I am very interested in and wanting to make a career out of. I am of 
            English descend and was born in Australia and plan on traveling to Japan in 
            the future. I was raised on a 40 acre hobby farm and still have some of my 
            favourite pets, my goats and dog.</p>
        <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
        <p>My interest in IT is along the lines of problem solving in a digital/technical
            format, programming being my favourite. I gained interest in IT over time as 
            opposed to an initial ‘lightbulb moment.’</p>
        <p>RMIT is highly recommended by Open Universities Australia and the intake dates 
            to do the Intro to IT and Intro to Programming courses were available at the 
            time I needed them. Being able to study my courses online is another reason I 
            chose RMIT.</p>
        <p>Having perused the information of the IT course I had a basic understanding of 
            what to expect, although I simply trusted that the Intro to IT course would 
            supply me with what I needed to learn and be able to proceed into a bachelor of IT.</p>
